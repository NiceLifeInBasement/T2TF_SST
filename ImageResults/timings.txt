### Contains bagtimes where different interesting scenarios happen

BAG: mavenNew_large.bag (== maven-2.bag)
	TIME: 		25
	SCENARIO: 	Car passing the c2x tracked object
			Close enough to possibly cause association issues, but in the current implementation the association is not
			lost.

	TIME:		96
	SCENARIO:	Objects are taking a turn at this time, lidar tracking is getting fuzzy
			As a result of that, the object visualization becomes very fuzzy ("noisy")
			Some issues with T2TA arise, but its hard to even visually tell cars and road boundaries apart
			(therefore, associating the c2x-point with any single lidar point seems near impossible)

	TIME: 		120
	SCENARIO: 	C2X object is not visible to the lidar scan (hidden behind other vehicle)
			This vehicle then proceeds to pass the c2x vehicle
			
	TIME:		150
	SCENARIO:	(lidar-)recording car passes the c2x vehicle
			c2x vehicle is slowly fading out of (lidar-)vision, while the c2x information is still being displayed
			(but "behind" the recording car, which is centered at (0|0)) 

	TIME:		195
	SCENARIO:	The lidar object that matches the c2x object loses it's ID due to splitting: The object splits up into
			two different ones (7389, 7622). The original object 7389 gets lost in a subsequent time step, but the
			new matching object 7622 is immediately recognized by the association algorithm (and no road boundary 
			is temporarily mapped to the c2x vehicle)

	TIME:		198
	SCENARIO:	Similar to the one @195s. The object gets split again (twice). The association is not lost in the process.

	TIME: 		200
	SCENARIO:	Cars take a right turn. The c2x vehicle is directly in front of the "self"-vehicle
			The lidar object tracking creates lots of objects that are hard to tell apart from the real cars
			The association is not particularly hard here, but this shows how object identification is really hard
			to do without looking at the point cloud
