#1:
    (not 100% sure, since I'm new to ROS)
    to subscribe to a certain message type, you need the package containing it as a dependency
    however, I only have access to the bag file, not the actual package

    would need the .msg files to read data from the bag


#2:
    message structure is not documented
    would probably get solved by getting the .msg files
    need to know this to correctly read ALL available data (instead of working only with the parts I found to be useful)
