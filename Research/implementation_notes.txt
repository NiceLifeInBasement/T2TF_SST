Most relevant data seems to be in topic /tracked_objects/scan
    >boxes>[i]>box>header>...
    this contains x,y coordinates, angle, length and width along with velocity information

    probably need to use this when looking for information to fuse


think about what coordinate system you will use, or if this is basically predetermined by the way the data is given


maybe start by using covariance intersection (CI) or FCI/I-FCI, try to get that running as a baseline
    since CI (variants) come with pretty clean formulas to implement
    and not a lot of data is needed for CI (see seeliger slides)
    from my current perspective this looks like the most promising algorithm for a baseline
