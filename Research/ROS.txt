Working in the Catkin Workspace (~/catkin_ws)
    this is the package location as well (create them using catkin_create_pkg

Use catkin_make to build packages
    after making packages, you need to "source ./devel/setup.bash" once
    or before executing anything in that terminal? not 100% sure

execute your file by using for example "rosrun t2tf_sst test.py"
    i.e. "rosrun <package_name> <executable_node_name>"
    for this the node needs to be executable (chmod +x <file>)

python files need to start with "#!/usr/bin/env python"
    no spaces allowed, no comments before that
    keyword "shebang line"

Importing messages from another package
    Make sure you always "source ./devel/setup.bash"
    The CMakeLists of the package with the messages need to have the following uncommented
        add_message_files(...)
        generate_messages(...)
    Also make sure CMakeLists has message_generation, message_runtime listed under find_package()
