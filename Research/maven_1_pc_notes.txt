Notes wrt displaying the point cloud contained in the maven-1.bag

In general, the fact that the points are at x/y-values like x.e+07 is kinda weird
According to some quick research, rviz has some known issues with this kind of size of values


To see anything:
    I manipulated all points: Reduce their x/y Coordinates by a fix offset (the first x/y coordinate measured)
       This is an attempt to move the data to somewhere around 0/0 without cluttering it too much into one point
       however, this doesnt work that great :)
    Increase the display size in rviz to some big value like 100
    Zoom out a lot ("distance" in the view(right side of the screen in rviz) for me was 31000)
    you can then see some boxes going back and forth in the display
    no road boundaries included like in the other data I assume
    its possible that this tracks only cars (the objects seem kinda car-like)

    All data is only in one slice (z=0), no layers like in the other bag topic /spherical_grid

    I think this is some weirdly offset data of only the cars going past

    you could consider using this data for the matching between points and boxes that are actual car objects
        however the point-to-box matching matches to almost all boxes again, however you know that most of the boxes
        plot road boundaries. maybe you can work something out using that though

    The point-to-box field shows how many points are included: 2018-<...>.bag has >400pts (ie 4x as many!)

    In general, im not sure if this data can be used in a meaningful way
