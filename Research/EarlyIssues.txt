### Tracking Issues before Implementation of the first Algorithm
### After the first-second day of working with the bag-data
###
### "Minor" in front of the issue number --> Minor question

# Summed up in the mail "Fragen bzgl rosbag daten"

###-----------------

#1:
    T2TF requires multiple data sources,
    currently we only have "/tracked_objects/scan" and data fields that are the same
        (e.g. "/tracked_objects/v2x_fusion_scan")

#1b:
    What topics that are used in the bag are relevant for T2TF?

#2:
    Is a full list of msg definitions available somewhere, or do all msg def need to be extracted from the bag manually?

Minor#3:
    THIS IS POSSIBLY JUST A FORMATTING ISSUE (try utf-8 etc in python itself maybe)
    THESE FIELDS MAY NOT BE RELEVANT AT ALL
    Certain data fields can not be easily read by rqt_bag
        "tracked_objects/v2x_fusion_scan.scan.point_cloud.data" for example (only has boxes etc)

#4:
    Covariance of tracking result?
