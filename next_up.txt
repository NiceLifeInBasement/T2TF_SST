Get graphics to work
Maybe instead of trying to log along as you receive data, receive data first and animate it later?
    Seems pretty weird though, would have to wait for data gen everytime

After that, consider algorithms to establish better tracking results without changing uid on tracked objects

Get a graph of how long which uid stays to see if some of them are so short that they essentially don't matter
